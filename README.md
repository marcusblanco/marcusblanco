# Hi, i'm Marcus

 
I'm learning how to code. I love making webpages with HTML,CSS and JavaScript. I also enjoy programming in C#,Java and C++ or Python sometimes.

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

- 🔨 I’m currently working on creating webpages and learning how to progam.
- 😀 I like to make beats, code, watching videos, and learn new things at my free time.
- 💬 I would be glad to have some useful advice from knowledgeable people.
